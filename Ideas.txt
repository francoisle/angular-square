Ideas to go further in this project:

- Improve history list:
--> Add CSS to the history list as well.
--> Click on an history item is possible to act like a click on the corresponding square.

- Color square component: edit square.
--> Input text that the user can enter and that will be displayed inside a square.
--> Change the color of a square.

- Add the possibility (a button ?) to reset the application:
--> Clear history.
--> Clear last click.
--> Route to "/".

- Add the possibility (a button ?) to change the order of the squares (random, rotation ?).
