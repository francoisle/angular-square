# Angular Squares

Welcome to this little Angular project which focuses on applying basic Angular concepts in order to get familiar with them.

In this little project we show 4 squares each of them with a particular color and make them clickable to perform some action when the user actually clicks on one of them:

- Display the color of the last clicked square.
- Display an history of the five last clicked squares.
- Route (via Angular Router) to the description page of the clicked square. 

This project has been built with the CLI which means every CLI commands works for this little project.

In particular, you get get started with an npm install followed by an ng serve --open.

Enjoy !
